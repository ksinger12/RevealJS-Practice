# RevealJS-Practice
Taking some old presentation info to create a demo with revealJS

## Goal

The goal here is to get a familiarity with the package to use in future presentations. I have integrated many of the plugins (both ones that come with the original installation and ones I have added from external resources). 

### Side Note
The original package is contained in the submodule. The package with my changes (updated index.html and added plugins is in the revealJS.js folder).
