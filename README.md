# RevealJS-Practice
Taking some old presentation info to create a demo with revealJS

## Goal

The goal here is to get a familiarity with the package to use in future presentations. I have integrated many of the plugins (both ones that come with the original installation and ones I have added from external resources). 

### Instructions
The original package is contained in the submodule. To show my presentation, clone the submodule and replace the index.html, as well as the plugin folder with the copies contained in this repository.
